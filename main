To create a script that triggers an alarm on your phone when you move a certain distance away from a Bluetooth tracker, you can use a mobile automation app like Tasker (for Android) or Shortcuts (for iOS). However, due to app permissions and restrictions, tracking the exact distance might be challenging. Instead, you can monitor the connection status (connected/disconnected) between your phone and the Bluetooth tracker, which indirectly reflects proximity.

Here’s a script using Tasker on Android:

Prerequisites
Install Tasker from the Google Play Store.
Pair your Bluetooth tracker with your phone.
Ensure your phone’s Bluetooth is enabled.
Tasker Script
Step 1: Create a Profile to Monitor Bluetooth Connection
Open Tasker.
Tap the "+" icon to create a new Profile.
Select State > Net > BT Connected.
In the Name field, enter the name of your Bluetooth tracker (exactly as it appears in your Bluetooth device list).
Tap the back arrow to save.
Step 2: Add an Exit Task
After selecting the Bluetooth tracker, Tasker will prompt you to add a task for when the Bluetooth tracker is disconnected.
Tap New Task and name it (e.g., "Alarm Trigger").
In the Task Edit screen, tap the "+" icon to add an action.
Select Media > Play Ringtone:
Configure the ringtone/alarm sound you want.
Set Loop to On if you want the alarm to repeat until stopped manually.
Tap the back arrow to save the task.
Optional Enhancements
Proximity-based Action (Advanced): If your Bluetooth tracker has an RSSI (signal strength) API, you can use apps like Automate or custom scripts with an Android SDK to monitor signal strength and estimate distance. This requires programming knowledge and possibly root access.
Notification Trigger: You can also configure Tasker to send a notification or vibrate instead of playing a ringtone.

Here’s how you can set up a similar feature on iOS using the Shortcuts app, along with advanced methods for Android if you're looking for a more precise distance-based approach.

Setting It Up on iOS Using Shortcuts
Prerequisites
Pair your Bluetooth tracker with your iPhone.
Install the Shortcuts app (if not already installed).
Ensure your tracker is connected and functional.
Step 1: Create an Automation
Open the Shortcuts app.
Navigate to the Automation tab.
Tap Create Personal Automation (or the "+" if you have existing automations).
Select Bluetooth as the trigger.
Choose your Bluetooth tracker from the list of paired devices.
Step 2: Add Actions
After selecting the tracker, tap Next.
Add the following action:
Play Sound: Use the “Play Sound” action to trigger an alarm sound.
You can choose any alert sound from your library or use system sounds.
Optional:
Add a Repeat Until action to continuously play the sound until manually stopped.
Use Show Notification if you want to display a warning message.
Step 3: Test Your Automation
Disconnect your Bluetooth tracker to simulate going out of range.
Ensure the alarm or notification is triggered as expected.
Limitations on iOS
iOS does not natively allow precise distance measurement using Bluetooth RSSI, but you can approximate proximity by monitoring the connection state (connected/disconnected).

Advanced Distance-Based Approach for Android
To estimate the exact distance to your Bluetooth tracker, you can use RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), which reflects the signal strength of the Bluetooth connection. Here's how:

Option 1: Using an App with RSSI Tracking
Install a Bluetooth RSSI Monitoring App: Apps like nRF Connect allow you to monitor RSSI.
Track RSSI Values:
RSSI values typically range between 0 (very close) to -100 (out of range).
You can estimate the distance using this formula:
Distance
=
1
0
(
Measured RSSI
−
TxPower
−
20
)
Distance=10 
( 
−20
Measured RSSI−TxPower
​
 )
 
Where TxPower is the signal strength at 1 meter.
Option 2: Automate with Tasker + JavaScript
Install Tasker and enable the JavaScript action.
Use a custom script to read RSSI values (requires Bluetooth API integration).
Set a threshold RSSI value to trigger the alarm.
Sample Script in Tasker:
javascript
Copy code
// Bluetooth RSSI monitor (pseudo-code, requires Bluetooth API integration)
const THRESHOLD_RSSI = -70; // Adjust for desired proximity
const deviceName = "MyBluetoothTracker";

// Check RSSI
const currentRSSI = getBluetoothRSSI(deviceName);
if (currentRSSI < THRESHOLD_RSSI) {
    triggerAlarm();
}

function triggerAlarm() {
    Tasker.runTask("Alarm Trigger");
}
Option 3: Custom App
If you have programming knowledge, you can create an app using Android Studio:

Use Android's Bluetooth API to monitor RSSI.
Set up a listener to trigger an alarm when the RSSI falls below a certain threshold.
Would you like guidance on using a specific app or writing custom code for these solutions?

Here’s a detailed guide for writing a custom app or script to monitor RSSI values and trigger an alarm when your phone moves too far from a Bluetooth tracker. I'll start with an Android app solution using Android Studio, followed by a Tasker and Automate integration if you prefer a no-code approach.

Option 1: Creating a Custom App (Android)
Prerequisites
Install Android Studio.
Pair your Bluetooth tracker with your phone.
Basic knowledge of Java/Kotlin programming.
Step 1: Set Up the Android Studio Project
Create a new project in Android Studio.
Choose an Empty Activity template.
Add the required permissions to the AndroidManifest.xml file:
xml
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
Step 2: Scan for Bluetooth Devices
Add code to discover and connect to your Bluetooth tracker.

Code Example (Java):
java
Copy code
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter;
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice;
import android.bluetooth.BluetoothManager;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private static final String TAG = "BluetoothRSSI";
    private BluetoothAdapter bluetoothAdapter;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        BluetoothManager bluetoothManager = (BluetoothManager) getSystemService(BLUETOOTH_SERVICE);
        bluetoothAdapter = bluetoothManager.getAdapter();

        if (bluetoothAdapter != null && bluetoothAdapter.isEnabled()) {
            startDiscovery();
        } else {
            Log.e(TAG, "Bluetooth is not enabled.");
        }
    }

    private void startDiscovery() {
        bluetoothAdapter.startDiscovery();
        bluetoothAdapter.getBluetoothLeScanner().startScan((device, rssi, scanRecord) -> {
            Log.d(TAG, "Device: " + device.getName() + ", RSSI: " + rssi);
            checkProximity(rssi);
        });
    }

    private void checkProximity(int rssi) {
        int threshold = -70; // RSSI threshold for distance
        if (rssi < threshold) {
            triggerAlarm();
        }
    }

    private void triggerAlarm() {
        Log.e(TAG, "Device is out of range!");
        // Code to play an alarm or send a notification
    }
}
Step 3: Test the App
Run the app on your phone.
Monitor the log output to see the RSSI values.
Ensure the alarm triggers when the RSSI drops below the threshold.
Option 2: Tasker + JavaScript
If you prefer using Tasker for automation without building an app, you can integrate AutoTools or JavaScript into Tasker.

Steps:
Install the Tasker app and the AutoTools plugin.
Use the AutoTools plugin to monitor RSSI if your Bluetooth tracker supports signal strength reporting.
Set a condition to trigger the alarm when RSSI falls below a certain level.
Sample Tasker JavaScript Code:
javascript
Copy code
// Mock function to get RSSI (replace with real API call if available)
function getRSSI(deviceName) {
    return -75; // Example RSSI value
}

const THRESHOLD = -70; // RSSI threshold for proximity
const deviceName = "MyBluetoothTracker";

if (getRSSI(deviceName) < THRESHOLD) {
    Tasker.runTask("AlarmTrigger");
}
Option 3: Automate (No-Code, Android)
Install the Automate app from the Play Store.
Create a new flow:
Add a Bluetooth RSSI block to monitor the signal strength of your tracker.
Add a Condition block to check if the RSSI is below a threshold (e.g., -70).
Add a Media Play block to play an alarm sound.
Would you like help setting up the app, writing more detailed code, or configuring any of the above solutions?
